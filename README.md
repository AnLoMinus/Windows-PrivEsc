## [PrintSpoofer.exe](https://github.com/dievus/printspoofer)
### PrintSpoofer exploit that can be used to escalate service user permissions on Windows Server 2016, Server 2019, and Windows 10.

To escalate privileges, the service account must have SeImpersonate privileges. To execute:
```cmd
PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
```
With appropriate privileges this should grant system user shell access.

## [ActiveDirectoryAttackTool](https://github.com/The-Viper-One/ActiveDirectoryAttackTool) 
- ADAT is a small tool used to assist CTF players and Penetration testers with easy commands to run against an Active Directory Domain Controller. 
- This tool is is best utilized using a set of known credentials against the host.

## [Phant0m](https://github.com/hlldz/Phant0m) | Windows Event Log Killer
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/179116846-1f44d88c-8724-4726-81b6-6786c6f73c51.png)
- Svchost is essential in the implementation of so-called shared service processes, where a number of services can share a process in order to reduce resource consumption. 
- Grouping multiple services into a single process conserves computing resources, and this consideration was of particular concern to NT designers because creating Windows processes takes more time and consumes more memory than in other operating systems, e.g. in the Unix family.
<br>

- This means briefly that; On Windows operating systems, svchost.exe manages the services and services are actually running under svchost.exe’s as threads.
- Phant0m targets the Event Log service and finding the process responsible for the Event Log service, it detects and kills the threads responsible for the Event Log service. 
- Thus, while the Event Log service appears to be running in the system (because Phant0m didn't kill process), it does not actually run (because Phant0m killed threads) and the system does not collect logs.

## [SpookFlare](https://github.com/hlldz/SpookFlare) 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/179117084-82a15257-492d-4c0a-9d7a-4f86efcc6ce2.png)
> - ### Loader, dropper generator with multiple features for bypassing client-side and network-side countermeasures.
> - SpookFlare has a different perspective to bypass security measures and it gives you the opportunity to bypass the endpoint countermeasures at the client-side detection and network-side detection. <br> SpookFlare is a loader/dropper generator for Meterpreter, Empire, Koadic etc. <br> SpookFlare has obfuscation, encoding, run-time code compilation and character substitution features. <br> So you can bypass the countermeasures of the target systems like a boss until they "learn" the technique and behavior of SpookFlare payloads. <br> <br>
> - Obfuscation
> - Encoding
> - Run-time Code Compiling
> - Character Substitution
> - Patched Meterpreter Stage Support
> - Blocked powershell.exe Bypass
